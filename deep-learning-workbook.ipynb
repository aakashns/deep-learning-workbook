    "\n",
    "1. Set up your dev environment with [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/), [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) & [Keras](https://keras.io/) (or any other ML framework). Follow [this guide](https://blog.keras.io/running-jupyter-notebooks-on-gpu-on-aws-a-starter-guide.html) if you wish to use a GPU on AWS.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Download the latest version of the workbook using the command:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aakashns/deep-learning-workbook/master/deep-learning-workbook.ipynb\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Change the file name, title and kernel as desired. This notebook was originally written with the kernel `conda:tensorflow_p36` on the [AWS Deep Learning AMI](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B01M0AXXQB).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Follow the steps described below, filling in the blanks (marked as `TODO`).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Once you're done building the final model, you can delete the cells containing instructions (like this one)."
